		<h2>Hi, I'm Ranjan K. Maji</h2>
			<p>I'm a researcher in computational biology.</p>

			<p>My research interests include: Machine learning, Deep learning, Gene Regulatory Networks, Cancer Biology, RNA bioinformatics, Next Gen Sequence Analysis and mathematical modelling.</p>

			<p >During my doctoral studies, I gained skills in interpreting machine learning models, feature selection techniques, bayesian optimization, network analysis, ensembling methods, statistical correlations and web framework models such as Django and Shiny. Currently, I am in the process of understanding deep learning models (convolutional neural networks, feed forward networks etc.), and gaining my skills in python deep learning frameworks such as pytorch, keras and tensorflow.</p>

			<p>I did my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from Calcutta University, Kolkata, India, though I worked in Bose Institute, Kolkata, India. My thesis topic was "Investigating the functional complexity of regulatory RNAs as versatile Modulators - A Systems Approach"</p>

			<p>Apart from the above academic interests, I have interests in protography, music etc. I will keep the blog updated as and when I come across interesting stuff. So, keep checking.</p>
